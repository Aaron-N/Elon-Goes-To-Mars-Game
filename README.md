# Elon-Goes-To-Mars-Game
A text-based adventure game, complete with a text parser that understands a number of simple phrases. You play as Elon on his quest to reach the planet Mars! ASCII art galore included free of charge. Engage your curiosity and intellect as you explore and think your way through the 15 areas of the game. Rather than interacting with the game by selecting from predetermined command options, you type in simple sentences that the game interprets and acts upon. You can gather objects during gameplay that interact with features as you journey from location to location. A series of roadblocks and obstacles will try to halt your progress, but all of them can be solved.

Hints: type in 'help' to get a list of commands that you can use, and 'look' to redisplay room information. Both will help if you get stuck.

To play, dowload the zip file, open cmd.exe on your machine, go to where to downloaded the zip file, unzip it and execute: python game.py
